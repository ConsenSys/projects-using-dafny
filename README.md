# Objective

The objective of this repository is to provide a [list of projects](./list.md) that use the
verification-friendly programming language [Dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny).

# Usage

Many projects are open-source and they can be a great opportunity to:

1. re-use/share Dafny code (e.g. libraries),
1. learn by example,
1. foster a community of developers.

# Contribution

If you want a project to be added to the list, you may make a pull request (fork this repository, make changes to your copy and then create a PR to the upstream).

Some minimal information should be provided about the project among them:

* name
* link to a public repository
* project's target: e.g. algorithms, concurrent system
* a brief description of the 
* what can be useful to others and re-used (e.g. a library with some `seq` lemmas, or arithmetic etc)

 Optionally we may provide:

* statistics (lines of code, number of lemmas)
* experience reports/papers/publications 
* a way to replicate the results, e.g. a Docker container. Dafny is under constant improvement, so it may be good to archive a project code/dafny version pair to be able to replicate the results.

And any other suggestions are most welcome!
